# Summary

This is a small treebank for Modern Standard Assyrian.It is the first ever treebank to be built for Assyrian. The treebank consists of 57 manually annotated sentences.

# Introduction

The treebank is a collection of sentences randomly collected from different sources, such as textbooks, grammar books and a translation of a short story.
Since the treebank is a small one, all the data is in the test file. We are hoping that continuous work to increase the size of the treebank will provide more data for training.
